2D Fighter Type Game

Objective is pretty straight forward... kill the other guy.

-left joystick to move.
-hold x and move to dash.
-square is melee attack.
-circle is ki blast.
-triangle is super move.
-down on the d pad is charge.
-r1 is block.
-Space saves location and stats of players
-c loads them

If you are blocking, you don't take damange, instead you lose ki.
